# This section describes an API service.
#
# Notes:
#  - type={service,external,binary}
#      - if type == service, a container will be built.
#      - if type == external, the URL and dependency order will be used.
#      - if type == binary, additional future parameters will be required for target OS, ARCH.
#  - language is required, unless type==external.
#     - currently language={golang, typescript-react}
#     - terraform is implied for configuring some parts of the solution
#     - docker / minikube is implied for configuring containers, etc.
#  - dependency is optional but helpful to identify the order of artifact build/deploy.
