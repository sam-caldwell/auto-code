#
# This YAML manifest defines a software project and should be consumable by a code generator to produce the
# project's basic implementation.
#

#
# global:
#   defines program global constants used to identify the program.
#
global:
  # name must be non-empty, alphanumeric (with _ and . also allowed) and not contain spaces.
  name: myDemo
  # description must be a non-empty string containing unicode characters
  description: This is a demonstration of the code generator
  # author must be a non-empty string
  author: Sam Caldwell
  # email must be a valid email address
  email: scaldwell@asymmetric-effort.com
  # copyright must be a valid US Copyright string
  copyright: (c) 2024 Asymmetric Effort, LLC
  # license must be a valid license type (proprietary, MIT, BSD, etc.)
  license: MIT
  # language must be one of the supported languages (e.g. go)
  language: go
  # version must follow semantic version formatting
  version: 0.0.1
#
# Config section:
#   defines the Configuration struct used to configure the program runtime using a variety of
#   sources (files, environment variables, cli, etc.)
#
config:
  #
  # sources:
  #   define the input sources used to configure the application in the order which they will be applied,
  #   such that the last source will override its predecessors. Each source must be defined in a named
  #   subsection (e.g. file, environment, commandline)
  #
  #   each source type can only appear once in the list.
  #
  sources:
    - file
    - environment
    - commandline
  #
  # properties:
  #   define the configuration object's properties.  This will result in a property and a getter/setter function pair
  #   as well as property type and validator specification to ensure data quality.
  #
  #   property type must be one of string, int, uint, etc.
  #
  properties:
    - listenAddress:
        type: string
        validator:
          class: pattern
          parameter: <ip address regex> # ToDo: create an ip address regex
        default: 0.0.0.0
    - listenPort:
        type: uint16
        validator:
          class: null
        default: 8080
    - protocol:
        type: string
        validator:
          class: pattern
          parameter: `^http[s]{0,1}$`
        default: http
  #
  # file:
  #   defines a configuration file data source by fileName, format (e.g. yaml) and a mapping of the yaml file content
  #   to a property listed in the properties section.  When the file is read, property values will be stored as the
  #   associated (mapped) property name and validated using the property validator and typing.
  #
  file:
    file: config.yaml
    # if required==true, then the file must exist or an error will be thrown.
    required: true
    # only yaml is supported at this time, but this should be extensible to include json in the future.
    format: yaml
    # the `map` associates a `property` to a config file record, where the config file record uses a dot-delimited
    # object notation.
    map:
      - listenAddress: network.address
      - listenPort: network.port
      - protocol: network.protocol
    #
    # environment:
    #   defines one or more environment variables whose values map to configuration properties.
    #   An environment variable is applied only if it is non-empty.
    #
    environment:
      - listenAddress: LISTEN_ADDRESS
      - listenPort: LISTEN_PORT
      - protocol: LISTEN_PROTOCOL
    #
    # commandline:
    #   defines one or more command-line arguments and maps them to a parameter.  This list is a list of properties
    #   which has one or both of the short and long argument types.  If the `required` property is true and the program
    #   runs without this commandline argument, an error should be thrown.
    #
    commandline:
      - listenAddress:
          required: false
          short: -a
          long: --listen-address
      - listenPort:
          required: false
          short: -p
          long: --listen-port
      - protocol:
          required: false
          long: --protocol
